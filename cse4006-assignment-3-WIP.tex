% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
When international students arrive at Hanyang University, they often seek affordable and short-term housing options. One of the most popular accommodations are Goshiwons like Hanyang Habitat. As members of this team currently living in Habitat, we would like to provide residents with a new toll that caters to their needs.

Living in Hanyang Habitat has given us firsthand insight into the challenges faced by exchange students. With approximately 70 international residents that come from more than 15 countries, it's evident that online communication platforms vary widely. For instance, Europeans prefer applications like WhatsApp or Instagram, while North Americans rely heavily on text messaging. In contrast, WeChat is very popular in certain Asian countries like China or Indonesia. In South Korea, KakaoTalk is the go-to messaging app, but its unique features and interface can pose a learning curve for newcomers, especially for those that do not speak Korean.


\subsection{Problem Statement}
Given these cultural differences regarding communication tools, we asked ourselves: which platform should Hanyang Habitat residents use to effectively communicate with one another? Our proposed solution is Habitat Connect, an announcement board with a user-friendly English interface.

As well as serving as an online communication tool, Habitat Connect offers more features that focus on the needs of Habitat residents. This includes a laundry checker that provides real-time updates on washer availability, an event and birthday calendar to keep everyone informed about upcoming celebrations, and an easy-to-use maintenance request system, ensuring a direct line of communication between the tenants and the apartment manager.

Habitat Connect ensures that all residents, regardless of their language and online backgrounds, can comfortably navigate and utilize the tool. This idea comes from a desire to foster a sense of community among students in Hanyang Habitat. We aim to enhance the living experience of international students, making their time at Hanyang University more comfortable and rewarding.

% REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
\section{Requirement Analysis}
\subsection{Register via Local Registration}
Upon entering Habitat Connect, users will encounter a “Register” button situated in the top right corner of the screen. Clicking on this button redirects the user to the registration page, where Habitat Connect offers support for both local and Google OAuth registration. If the user chooses to register via local registration, they will be asked for a valid email address and a password. Once the user initiates the registration process, the inputs are processed internally. That is, we perform the checking of a valid email address and password format. If the validation is successful, we create the user’s account within our database.

The next step of the registration process redirects users to the “Complete Profile” page, where they need to provide additional details to set the profile account. Users will provide a username, birthdate, and Habitat’s room number. The registration process is complete when the user clicks on the “Complete profile” button, successfully passing the internal input validation, and is then redirected to the main announcement page of Habitat Connect.
\subsection{Log in via Local Registration}
Upon entering Habitat Connect, users will notice a “Log in” button situated in the top right corner of the screen, positioned to the left of the registration button. Clicking on this button redirects the user to the login page, where Habitat Connects offers support for both local and Google OAuth login processes. If the user chooses to login locally, they will be asked for an email address and password. Then, the system conducts an internal search for the user in the database. If the user is found, they will be seamlessly redirected to the main announcement page of Habitat Connect. On the other hand, if the user credentials are not registered in the system’s database, the user will be prompted to provide alternative credentials
\subsection{Register via Google OAuth}
When users choose to register with Google, they engage in Google OAuth, a secure process simplifying registration. This method lets users authorize third-party apps like Habitat Connect, using Google credentials without revealing their password. Users initiate this process by clicking "Register with Google" on Habitat Connect's registration page. After selecting their Google account, they may need to log in if not already. Google prioritizes user privacy, presenting requested permissions for approval. Once granted, Google generates an OAuth token, confirming identity and consent. Our system creates the user's account in our database without further validation, leveraging Google's checks. It is important to note that when users register via Google OAuth, their Habitat Connect account lacks a password field. As a result, users who register with Google OAuth can only login using Google.

The next step of the registration process redirects users to the “Complete Profile” page, where they complete their profile setup. From here, the process is the same as for the local registration.

\subsection{Log in via Google OAuth}
Logging into Habitat Connect with Google OAuth offers users a host of advantages, with convenience, security, and efficient access management being chief among them. This approach eliminates the cumbersome need to remember and juggle numerous usernames and passwords for different online platforms, simplifying the user experience significantly. Furthermore, users maintain a high level of control over their digital footprint, with the ability to easily revoke access to specific services through their Google account settings whenever they deem it necessary. This synergy between ease of use and robust data security underscores the appeal and practicality of logging in via Google OAuth. Once Google successfully completes the login validation, users are seamlessly redirected to the main announcement page of Habitat Connect.
\subsection{Dashboard}
The dashboard is the main page. The user is able to see all announcements ever posted, except those deleted by their corresponding authors. Regarding announcements, the following actions are available for the user:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Post} an announcement: users can write announcements that can only contain ASCII characters. Once they choose to post the announcement, it will be available in the dashboard to every user registered in Habitat Connect. The ownership of the announcement is registered as well..
    \item \textbf{Edit} an announcement: users can edit the title and/or body of their posted announcements.
    \item \textbf{Delete} an announcement: users are able to delete their posted announcements. They will no longer appear in the dashboard, and they will be removed from the system’s database.
    \item \textbf{Comment} on an announcement: registered users can comment on posted announcements. Comments can only contain ASCII characters. Furthermore, the ownership of the comment is available for every user to see.
    \item \textbf{Edit} a comment: users can edit their posted comments.
    \item \textbf{Delete} a comment: users are able to delete their posted comments. They will no longer appear as comments in the announcement view, and they will be removed from the system’s database.
    \item \textbf{Search} an announcement: users can search for announcements by entering keywords, which are then searched in both the title and body of the announcement.
\end{itemize}
% waiting
\subsection{Calendar view}
The system will provide a calendar view for users that automatically displays other users' birthdays based on their sign-up information. The calendar view will be monthly, and it can be switched between months with the help of navigation arrows on each side of the calendar. Users should be able to click on a specific date on the calendar to view the list of birthdays for that date, including the names of the users celebrating their birthdays.
% waiting
\subsection{Laundry checker}
This function will be on the left side of the main page in the form of an icon, and once clicked, users will be taken to another page where they will see each washer, which is assigned a unique number. The status of each washer is displayed in the Status column, with different colors to make it visually clear: IN USE is displayed in red, AVAILABLE is displayed in green, and FINISHED is displayed in white. Visually, it will be in a table-like format for easy understanding. Each washer has a set of action buttons next to it. The available actions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AVAILABLE (green button): users can click this button when they are going to use the washer. Once clicked, the washer’s status will change to IN USE, in the color red.
    \item FINISHED (white button): once a user is done using the washer, they will click a button that will change the status back to AVAILABLE, displayed in green.
\end{itemize}

There may be additional features such as timers to display how long a washer has been in use, as well as user-friendly tooltips or information icons that can provide additional information or instructions.
% waiting
\subsection{Maintenance requests}
Under the laundry checker icon, we can find the Maintenance Request icon. Once it is clicked, users will be taken to a new page. There will be two text boxes to create a Ticket: the first textbox will be the ticket name (for example “No Hot Water”), and the second text box will be the description of the maintenance issue with a maximum of 200 characters. Once the ticket is set up, there will be a Submit Ticket button at the bottom of the page. Once clicked, an email will automatically be sent to the apartment manager's private email. The page for the user after clicking the Submit Ticket button will also change. In the first half of the page, we will find a message saying “Your ticket has been submitted!”. Under that will be the status of the ticket which can be one of two options: Under Review (which will automatically be selected), and Ticket Completed. Once the user’s request has been completed in person, they can click the Ticket Completed option on the Maintenance Request page, which will update the user’s page back to the original create a ticket page.
% waiting
\subsection{User feedback Support}
In order to manage the website without bugs, we need a substantial amount of feedback from users. This is a function that most every high level website has in order to enhance user experience. At the top right of the screen, where “Profile” is, one of the options under above “Settings” is a “Report Bug” option. Once clicked, the user will be taken to a separate page, where similar to an email, will have a Title and description text box with a maximum of 300 characters. Once both are filled and the user clicks “Submit”, an email will automatically be sent to an admin regarding the bug. This will also be used as a “Support Ticket”, whenever someone needs to get in contact with an admin regarding an issue they have about their account.
% waiting
\subsection{User profile options}
The user profile is a fundamental component of an application, serving as a repository of user-specific information and a platform for users to manage and personalize their experience within the system. The user profile typically encompasses several key options and functionalities designed to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of the application's users. However, to keep the concept of this web application, the changes the user can make to their profile is limited. On the “Profile” section and “Edit” subsection, the user will be taken to a new page, where they can apply one of 3 options regarding their account. The first option is to switch to anonymous mode, where their room number and name will be hidden. With this, the user is still able to read the announcement chat and use the washer checker, however they cannot type in the announcement chat or create a maintenance manager ticket. The second option is to edit their username, as upon signing up for our website, their real names are used for the users accounts. The users only have the option to change their usernames once a month. The last option they have is to change their profile pictures. There is no limit to this option and the users can change it as many times as they please.

All software development tools are free of use. Furthermore, since Windows11 and macOS are already in use, we will not count them as costs.

\subsection{Software in use}
Today people rely on widely-used software like Discord for chatting, Google Calendar for planning, and FamilyWall for staying organized. Our upcoming project takes inspiration from these popular tools and blends them into one. Our software will make it easy for people living in the same place to chat, schedule events, and share information, enhancing the way they interact and stay connected.

\subsection{Task distribution}
In such a collaborative project among three students, roles have been thoughtfully distributed to capitalize on our individual strengths. We believe that not dividing the tasks will result in an inefficient and not realistic way of software development. The workload can be divided into distinct categories, each focusing on a crucial aspect of Habitat Connect. The tasks are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Management}: responsible for checking up on each team member work, ensuring adherence to deadlines, and coordinating the overall workflow
    
    \item \textbf{Documentation}: responsible for writing the pdf and creating the LaTex files, ensuring to present a well-structured and comprehensive overview of the project
    
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: charged with the responsibility of developing the frontend side of the software. This includes crafting the user interface, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience, and design and implement every component for user engagement
    
    \item \textbf{Backend}: charged with the responsibility of developing the backend side of the software. This includes handling the database, server-side logic, and ensuring that every software component correctly adheres to all specified requirements
    
\end{itemize}

After thoughtful evaluation, the final assignment of tasks to each team member has been documented in the following table:

\begin{table}[H]

These features include the ability to post announcements, which can include text, as well as making information accessible to all registered users and ensuring transparency through clear ownership attribution. Users can also edit their announcements to keep them up-to-date and relevant, and they have the option to delete announcements if they become outdated or if the announcement was simply canceled. Additionally, users can engage in discussions by commenting on announcements, with comment ownership clearly visible, promoting accountability and a sense of community within the platform.

\section*{Post Announcement button}
Once clicked, the user will be taken to a different screen, where they have to input 3 options: title, date, and location. All of these fields must be completed in order to post an announcement. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Title:} character string of maximum 50 characters
    \item \texttt{Date:} DD/MM/YYYY format
    \item \texttt{Location:} character string  of maximum 70 characters
\end{itemize}
Once the user clicks the “Post Announcement” button, the screen will reload into the main Announcement page with the new announcement updated.

    \caption{Post announcement page}
    \label{fig:Post announcement page}
    \end{figure}

\section*{Edit Announcement button}
This button will be visible directly on the announcement the user wants to edit. Once clicked, the user will be taken to another page, similar to the Post Announcement page where they can edit the title, date, or location. The only difference between this page and the Post Announcement page is the “Post Announcement” button being changed to “Save”. Once clicked, the updated content will be visible on Announcement.

    \label{fig:Edit announcement page}
    \end{figure}

\section*{Delete Announcement button}
This button will be on the same row as the Edit Announcement Button. Once clicked, the user will be given a confirmation popup saying “Are you sure you want to delete this announcement?”, with a Cancel/Delete option. If delete is clicked,  the announcement will be deleted immediately without the page reloading, and the announcement below it will move up one.

    \caption{Delete announcement confirmation popup}
    \label{fig:Delete announcement confirmation popup}
    \end{figure}

\section*{Comment button}
This button will also be on the same row as Edit and Delete. Once clicked, the user will be taken to another page. In this page, the comment history of past users can be seen on the announcement, as well as a text box where users can type and post a comment, which will also be the only action available for the user in this page.  The order will be from the latest comment to last.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Post comment text box:} character string maximum 150 characters
\end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \caption{Comment example}
    \label{fig:Comment example}
    \end{figure}
Once the “Post comment” button is clicked, the comment will be at the top of the list of comments.


\subsection{Calendar view}
The calendar view can be directly accessed through the task bar on the left side of the screen. It is a dedicated feature within the Habitat Connect platform, designed to commemorate and celebrate the special occasions of its users. It enables users to keep track of birthdays, create memorable moments, and foster a sense of community through shared celebrations. This page will not have any actions, and is more of a visual aid for birthdays. Users will see the birthdays of the current month, but it is also possible to change the calendar view to display past/next months birthdays.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/calendar_view.png}
    \caption{Calendar view page}
    \label{fig:Calendar view page}
    \end{figure}
Upon clicking a birthday on the calendar, a popup will showcase, which allows users to see the detailed view of the birthdays.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/birthday_details.png}
    \caption{Birthday details}
    \label{fig:Birthday details}
    \end{figure}


\subsection{Laundry checker}
Another one of the main four functions of the application is the laundry checker, which will have several actions that the user is allowed to do. Visually, it will consist of a table with three rows: washing machine number, current status, and change status. The change status row is the only row where users can perform an action.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/laundry_checker_page.png}
    \caption{Laundry checker page}
    \label{fig:Laundry checker page}
    \end{figure}

\section*{Current status}
There is no action to be done in this row. It is simply to show the status of the washer and is completely dependent on the “Change status” row. Moreover, if a user forgets to click the “Finish” button once their wash is finished, the status will automatically change to “Available” after 2 hours.

\section*{Change status}
The users can perform two actions, either click the “Finish” button or the “Use” button. If the status is “In Use”, users only have the option to click the “Finish” button. On the other hand, if the status is “Available”, the user will only have the option to click the “Use” button.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Finish button:} only available when Status is “In use”. Once clicked, the status will automatically change to "Available".
    \item \texttt{Use button:} only available when status is “Available”. Once clicked, the status will automatically change to “In use”.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Maintenance requests}
Habitat Connect simplifies the process of submitting maintenance requests, streamlining the user experience. Users can conveniently log requests for repairs, improvements, or assistance, ensuring that their concerns are addressed promptly. The platform not only fosters efficiency but also enhances transparency by allowing users to track the status and progress of their requests. Upon opening the maintenance requests tab on the taskbar, the user will be taken to a new page in which they can perform a maintenance request.
The requests made by the users contain the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Title:} string of maximum 20 characters
    \item \texttt{Description:} string of maximum 300 characters
\end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/submit_ticket_page.png}
    \caption{Submit ticket page}
    \label{fig:Submit ticket page}
    \end{figure}
Once the user clicks the “Submit Ticket” button, the page will update, confirming the user's maintenance request in the form of a ticket. A table will also be shown, showcasing the ticket ID, ticket status, and ticket title. No action can be performed once loaded to this page. Only one ticket is allowed at a time for a user. Furthermore, the ticket will automatically clear after three days.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/submitted_ticket_example.png}
    \caption{Example of a submitted ticket in progress}
    \label{fig:Example of a submitted ticket in progress}
    \end{figure}
The ticket, once submitted, will be automatically sent to an admin/apartment manager in the form of an email. At this point, the maintenance issue should be verbally deliberated between the tenant and admin. Once the maintenance request has been solved, it will be displayed as a completed ticket. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/submitted_ticket_example_2.png}
    \caption{Example of a submitted ticket solved}
    \label{fig:Example of a submitted ticket solved}
    \end{figure}


\subsection{Loading page}
Upon the initial launch of the page, users can expect a brief loading time of approximately 3 seconds before reaching the main announcement board. This short delay allows the various elements and objects on the web page to load smoothly, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience. The loading screen will consist of our logo and a loading icon upon every reload. Scrolling between taskbar functions will not cause the main reload visuals to pop up.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/loading_page.png}
    \caption{Loading page}
    \label{fig:Loading page}
    \end{figure}


\subsection{Notifications}
Notifications are an essential part of a community platform to make sure all users are caught up on announcements and their maintenance requests, as well as each other’s  birthdays. For users to check their notifications, they must look at the top right of their screen and locate a bell with an exclamation point. Once they click that bell, they will see a listing of their notifications. In order to keep a simplistic approach and not overwhelm users with unnecessary notifications, they will only receive alerts from new announcements, the status of maintenance requests, and birthdays. Moreover, one of the main causes for concern is if a announcement notification text is too long to fit in the bell’s textbox, however, to compensate, if a notification strings surpass the max notification string of  more than 13 characters, then on that 13th character, there will be a “...” to signify there is a longer message being transcribed. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/notifications_example.png}
    \caption{Example of notifications}
    \label{fig:Example of notifications}
    \end{figure}


\section*{Clear button}
To clear every notification in the bell box, users can safely click the “Clear” button at the bottom middle of the bell box. Once clicked, the notification will be completely cleared and  cannot be retrieved again.

\section*{Exit button}
There is no actual exit button. Instead, to exit the notification bell box, users can click anywhere on the screen and it will dissipate the text box. 


\subsection{User feedback support}
Customer feedback is highly valued and plays a pivotal role in our commitment to delivering an exceptional user experience. Input from our valued users is incredibly important, as it enables us to continually enhance services. If users have suggestions for new features, come across any issues, or wish to share their thoughts, they should refer to the “User Feedback Support” button at the bottom left of the web page. Developers will be weary of every feedback, as the submit button will make a new entry of bugs or possible new features for the admins in the database collection. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figs/feedback_button.png}
    \caption{User feedback button}
    \label{fig:User feedback button}
    \end{figure}

\section*{User feedback button}
Upon clicking the “User Feedback” button, a text box will automatically appear. In this text box, a user can provide feedback or report bugs on the web page within 150 characters.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/feedback_page.png}
    \caption{User feedback page}
    \label{fig:User feedback page}
    \end{figure}
When the submit button is clicked, the feedback will automatically be relayed in email form to website developers.


\subsection{User profile options}
In the user profile section, users have the flexibility to make adjustments to several key aspects of their accounts to ensure a personalized experience. They are able to modify the birthday (in case of an initial mistake), update the username to reflect a new online identity, and change the profile picture to express their personality. To find user profile options, users must look at the top right of the website with the profile icon, and click “Edit” in order to end up on the profile screen.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/profile_page.png}
    \caption{Profile page}
    \label{fig:Profile page}
    \end{figure}

\section*{Change password}
The user can change their passwords as many times as they want. However, passwords cannot be repeated. They must also follow the original protocols regarding the required elements of passwords. Upon changing the password, a confirmation email will be sent to the user.

\section*{Change birthday}
Upon initially signing up for our web applications, users can commonly mistakenly put down the wrong birthday. However our feature allows users to correct that mistake. This feature can be used infinite times.

\section*{Change username}
Within the user profile, users can retain the ability to modify their username to better suit their  identity within Habitat Connect. To enhance freedom of expression, users will have limited restrictions upon choosing their usernames. Restrictions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Username length:} string of maximum 11 characters
    \item \texttt{Special characters:} 1 special character allowed
    \item \texttt{Duplication: } string cannot be identical to another username in use
\end{itemize}

\section*{Change profile picture}
If users want to further showcase their personality, they can add/edit their profile picture so that other users can see. There will be no restrictions for this feature, and users can change their profile pictures as much as they want.

\section*{Module 1: Frontend}
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{figs/frontend_module.png}
    \caption{Frontend module}
    \label{fig:Frontend module}
    \end{figure}
    
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textsc{Purpose:} The frontend module is our project's user-facing interface, which is intended to be engaging and intuitive. The purpose of the frontend is enabling possibilities for creating announcements and repair requests, as well as real-time monitoring of washing machine statuses and more. This module ensures a seamless user experience by presenting data fetched from the backend, with client-side validation delivering quick feedback. It connects to backend APIs to do tasks including creating, updating, and deleting announcements and maintenance requests. The interface is responsive and not dependent on any specific devices, with a component-based architecture for modular development and scalability. The use of specific visual components improves the entire user experience by making interactions with announcements, calendar, maintenance requests, washing machine status, and profile setting more dynamic and interesting.

    \item \textsc{Functionality:} The frontend functionality is crafted using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a solid foundation for the user interface. HTML structures the content, while CSS adds style, ensuring a visually appealing design. JavaScript, along with the EJS templating engine, provides dynamic content updates and interactivity. Bootstrap, a powerful CSS framework, enhances responsiveness and streamlines the design process with pre-built components. The integration of these technologies results in a maintainable structure, enabling efficient development. The application's frontend leverages AJAX for asynchronous data retrieval, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. Furthermore, responsive design principles are implemented to guarantee compatibility across various devices, making it easy for users to create announcements, submit maintenance requests, and more functionalities effortlessly.

            \item[-] view-ann.ejs : this page serves as the view for a specific announcement within the dashboard. It displays the announcement's title, body, and creator, and provides functionality for the announcement owner to update or delete the announcement. Users who are not the announcement owner can only view the announcement details. Additionally, the page includes a comments section, allowing users to view existing comments and, if they are the comment creator, update or delete their comments
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    % waiting
    \item \textsc{Where is it taken from?:}

    \item \textsc{How and why we use it?:} HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and EJS form a robust frontend toolkit. HTML structures content, CSS styles layouts, and Bootstrap ensures consistency. JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling dynamic features. EJS, integrated with Node.js, dynamically generates HTML based on server-side data. Since we have Android and iOS users in our group we decided against developing a mobile application and instead chose to focus on a web-application that can provide us with new programming experiences and help us in future projects.
